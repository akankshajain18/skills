# Workflow Triggering (AEM 6.5 LTS)

All mechanisms to start a workflow on AEM 6.5 LTS — from UI, programmatic API, HTTP API, Manage Publication, and replication-linked triggers.

## Audience

Developers and integrators starting AEM 6.5 LTS workflows — from the author UI (Timeline, Manage Publication), backend services (`WorkflowSession` API, Sling Scheduler, event handlers), CI/CD pipelines (HTTP API), or content events (launchers, replication triggers).

## Variant Scope

- AEM 6.5 LTS only.
- Includes replication-linked triggering and legacy `/etc`-based workflow packages.
- **Not for AEM as a Cloud Service.** If the target instance is AEMaaCS, stop and use the cloud-service variant of this skill — traditional replication agents do not exist, HTTP API auth differs, and `/etc/workflow/...` paths are deprecated. Patterns documented here will not work as written on AEMaaCS.

## Dependencies

This skill is downstream of two others — both must be in place before any trigger fires:

- **workflow-model-design** — the model you trigger must already be deployed and synced to `/var/workflow/models/<name>`. Triggering a non-deployed model fails with `Workflow model not found`.
- **workflow-development** — every `WorkflowProcess` and `ParticipantStepChooser` referenced by the model must be registered as an OSGi service before the first instance starts. Otherwise the instance fails on first execution with `Process not found`.

## Prerequisites

- AEM 6.5 LTS author instance reachable (local, dev, or sandbox).
- Workflow model deployed and visible at `/var/workflow/models/<name>` (verify via **Tools → Workflow → Models** or `curl /var/workflow/models/<name>.json`).
- For programmatic / API triggers: a Maven bundle to hold the trigger code and a service user mapped via `ServiceUserMapper`.
- For HTTP API triggers from non-local environments: a service-account credential, never the default admin password.

## Required Permissions

- `workflow-users` (or equivalent) — start workflows from the Timeline UI or Manage Publication.
- `workflow-administrators` (or equivalent) — terminate, suspend, or resume instances; required for HTTP `DELETE /api/workflow/instances/...`.
- Service user with `jcr:read` on `/var/workflow/models/` and `jcr:read,jcr:write` on `/var/workflow/instances/` for programmatic triggering. The `workflow-process-service` system user already has these on a stock 6.5 LTS install.

## Triggering Mechanisms Summary

| Mechanism | Use Case |
|---|---|
| **Timeline UI** | One-off manual start on a single page or asset |
| **Manage Publication** | Multi-page batch, integrates with publish pipeline |
| **WorkflowSession API** | Backend Java code, scheduled jobs, event handlers |
| **HTTP Workflow API** | REST calls, scripts, external integrations |
| **Replication Trigger** | Auto-start on replication agent events (6.5 LTS only — see Section 5) |
| **Workflow Launchers** | Automatic on JCR events — see `workflow-launchers` skill |

### Common Scenarios

Use this table to route a developer's intent to the right mechanism:

| Developer intent | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| "Author clicks Start Workflow on a single page" | Timeline UI |
| "Publish 10+ pages with a review step" | Manage Publication |
| "Backend service starts a workflow per record" | WorkflowSession API |
| "Nightly batch job processes pending assets" | Sling Scheduler + WorkflowSession API |
| "CI pipeline triggers review after deploy" | HTTP Workflow API |
| "Auto-start on every DAM upload" | Workflow Launcher (see `workflow-launchers`) |
| "Auto-start when content is replicated" | Replication Trigger (6.5 LTS only — see Section 5) |

## 1. Manual via Timeline UI

1. Open a page or asset → **Timeline** (clock icon) → **Start Workflow**
2. Select model, optionally enter title and comment
3. Click **Start**

## 2. Manage Publication (Multi-Page)

1. Sites Console → select pages → **Manage Publication**
2. Check **Include Workflow** and select a model
3. Click **Publish** or **Publish Later**

AEM creates a workflow package — a `cq:Page` collection built from the workflow-collection template (`/libs/cq/workflow/components/collection/page`) — under `/var/workflow/packages/` (newer 6.5 LTS) or `/etc/workflow/packages/` (legacy fallback). Detect at runtime via `payload.adaptTo(ResourceCollection.class)`; do not rely on a primary-type check (it's a `cq:Page`, indistinguishable from an ordinary page by type alone).

> **The selected workflow model must be designed for multi-page payloads.** Its PROCESS steps must adapt the payload to `ResourceCollection` and iterate the members (with a fallback for the single-payload case). A workflow designed only for a single `JCR_PATH` page payload will fail on the first step when given a workflow package. See workflow-model-design Pattern 6 and workflow-development Pattern 6.

## 3. Programmatic (WorkflowSession API)

```java
@Component(service = WorkflowStarterService.class)
public class WorkflowStarterService {

    @Reference
    private ResourceResolverFactory resolverFactory;

    public String startWorkflow(String payloadPath, String modelId) throws WorkflowException, LoginException {
        Map<String, Object> auth = Collections.singletonMap(
            ResourceResolverFactory.SUBSERVICE, "workflow-starter");
        try (ResourceResolver resolver = resolverFactory.getServiceResourceResolver(auth)) {
            WorkflowSession wfSession = resolver.adaptTo(WorkflowSession.class);
            WorkflowModel model = wfSession.getModel(modelId);
            if (model == null) {
                // getModel returns null when the model isn't deployed/synced.
                // Fail fast with a clear message — the next call would NPE silently.
                throw new WorkflowException("Workflow model not found: " + modelId);
            }
            WorkflowData data = wfSession.newWorkflowData("JCR_PATH", payloadPath);
            data.getMetaDataMap().put("workflowTitle", "Triggered by batch job");

            // startWorkflow() is non-blocking — it returns immediately with a handle;
            // step execution happens asynchronously on the Sling job queue.
            Workflow instance = wfSession.startWorkflow(model, data);
            return instance.getId();
        }
    }
}
```

**Model ID format:** `/var/workflow/models/my-workflow` (runtime path)

For `/etc/workflow/models/` legacy models, the ID is `/etc/workflow/models/my-workflow`.

## 4. HTTP Workflow API

> **Local development only.** The `curl -u admin:admin` examples target a local author at `localhost:4502` with the default admin password. Never run them against a shared, stage, or production instance, and never with default `admin:admin` credentials outside an isolated dev box. For production triggers from external systems, use a service-account token or short-lived OAuth credentials instead.

```bash
# Start
curl -u admin:admin -X POST \
  "http://localhost:4502/api/workflow/instances" \
  -d "model=/var/workflow/models/my-workflow" \
  -d "payloadType=JCR_PATH" \
  -d "payload=/content/my-site/en/home" \
  -d "workflowTitle=My Test Run"

# List running instances
curl -u admin:admin \
  "http://localhost:4502/api/workflow/instances?state=RUNNING"

# Terminate an instance
curl -u admin:admin -X DELETE \
  "http://localhost:4502/api/workflow/instances/<instanceId>"
```

**HTTP response shape:**
- POST success: HTTP 201 Created with the new instance path in the `Location` response header (e.g., `Location: /var/workflow/instances/server0/2026-04-28/14_my-workflow_1`). Capture this in CI scripts to track the instance later.
- POST failure: 4xx (404 if `model=` path doesn't exist; 403 if the caller lacks `workflow-users`; 400 if payload is missing or malformed) or 5xx, with a Sling JSON error body.
- GET on `?state=RUNNING`: returns a JSON array of instance summaries.
- DELETE success: HTTP 200 OK; the instance is terminated immediately.

**Cancellation semantics — read before using DELETE:**
- Termination is **irreversible**. Already-completed steps are not rolled back; their JCR writes stay.
- The currently-executing step is interrupted at the next safe point. In-flight `WorkflowProcess.execute()` calls are not gracefully completed — they are abandoned.
- Once terminated, the instance is `ABORTED` and cannot be resumed. To "retry," start a new instance.
- For business-critical workflows, prefer `suspend()` then `resume()` (or fix the underlying issue) over `terminate()`.

## 5. Replication-Linked Trigger (6.5 LTS Only)

Configure via **Tools → Replication → Agents → default** → check **Default Agent** properties to associate a workflow with replication events. Or use a Workflow Launcher targeting `/var/audit/com.day.cq.replication/`.

## Verifying the Trigger

A successful trigger call does **not** mean the workflow is running successfully — `startWorkflow()` is async. After triggering, confirm the instance is alive:

| Surface | How |
|---|---|
| Author UI | **Tools → Workflow → Instances** — filter by model name; the new instance should appear in `RUNNING` or `SUSPENDED` |
| HTTP | `curl -u admin:admin "http://localhost:4502/api/workflow/instances?state=RUNNING&model=/var/workflow/models/<name>"` |
| Java | The `Workflow` returned by `startWorkflow()` — `instance.getId()` and `instance.getState()` (`RUNNING`, `SUSPENDED`, `COMPLETED`, `ABORTED`, `FAILED`) |

### When the trigger succeeds but the workflow doesn't progress

If the instance never advances past START, or appears in **Tools → Workflow → Failures**:

- **Most common:** a referenced `WorkflowProcess` is not deployed, registered, or active. Look for `Process not found` in `error.log` against the instance ID. Confirm the bundle is active and the `process.label` is registered. See [workflow-development](../workflow-development/SKILL.md) Dependencies.
- **Less common:** the workflow job queue is saturated, the payload was deleted between trigger and execution, the model was changed mid-flight, or a participant chooser returned a non-existent principal.
- **For full diagnosis** (stuck instances, thread pool, JMX remediation): see [workflow-debugging](../workflow-debugging/SKILL.md).

## Architecture Considerations

Triggering is the surface where workflow load is *created* — apply these before deploying any auto-trigger:

- **Async by default.** `startWorkflow()` is non-blocking; it returns a handle and step execution happens asynchronously on the Sling job queue. Do not write code that expects the workflow to be complete on return. To wait, poll `instance.getState()` or use a downstream notification step.
- **Cap bulk triggers.** Any trigger driven by a JCR query, directory scan, or external batch must enforce a hard cap per run (see the Sling Scheduler example in [programmatic-api.md](./references/workflow-triggering/programmatic-api.md)). Triggering 10 000 workflows in a tight loop saturates the workflow job queue and pins the calling thread.
- **Use transient workflows for high-volume triggers.** When a workflow is short-lived and triggered at high frequency (asset processing, replication side-effects), set `transient="true"` on the model — see the workflow-model-design Architecture Considerations. Persistent workflows in this regime bloat `/var/workflow/instances` quickly.
- **Avoid recursive triggers.** A `WorkflowProcess.execute()` that starts another workflow on the same payload — or a launcher that re-fires on the writes its own workflow performs — creates an infinite loop. Guard with a metaData flag (`alreadyTriggered=true`) or trigger on a different payload subtree.
- **Stack mechanisms cautiously.** Pairing a Workflow Launcher and a replication-linked trigger on the same content fires *two* workflows per content change. Pick one mechanism per content event.
- **Initiator semantics under service-user triggers.** When a service user calls `startWorkflow()`, the engine-set `initiator` metadata becomes the service-user ID, not a human. Downstream PARTICIPANT steps that route by `initiator`, or audit code that expects a human user, will misbehave. Pass the human user explicitly via a custom metadata key when needed.

## Guardrails

- Use a service user — never `loginAdministrative()`.
- Model ID must be the `/var/workflow/models/` runtime path.
- For multi-page batch triggering, prefer Manage Publication over programmatic creation of workflow packages.
