# Workflow Orchestrator — AEM 6.5 LTS

## Audience

AEM 6.5 LTS developers (and the IDE LLM acting on their behalf) building, deploying, debugging, or operating Workflow models, process steps, launchers, or programmatic workflow starts on a local or dev author instance.

## Variant Scope

**AEM 6.5 LTS only.** If the user is on AEM as a Cloud Service, stop and load the cloud-service variant of this orchestrator. JCR-event launchers, JMX-driven remediation (`restartStaleWorkflows`, `purgeCompleted`, etc.), and the `/etc → /libs → /conf` overlay chain documented here do not apply 1:1 on AEMaaCS.

## Purpose

Master entry point for AEM Workflow tasks on AEM 6.5 LTS. Read this skill first. It classifies the user's request and routes to the right sub-skill.

## Dependencies

This orchestrator routes into six sub-skills:

- `workflow-model-design` — design models (steps, splits, joins) and model XML
- `workflow-development` — implement `WorkflowProcess`, `ParticipantStepChooser`, variables and metadata
- `workflow-triggering` — start workflows from code, HTTP API, or Manage Publication
- `workflow-launchers` — configure `cq:WorkflowLauncher` for event-driven start
- `workflow-debugging` — diagnose stuck or failed workflows on an accessible instance
- `workflow-triaging` — symptom→runbook mapping for multi-instance / log-mining contexts (load only when the user explicitly invokes that context)

## Cross-Cutting Invariants

These apply to every workflow task; surface them regardless of which sub-skill is loaded:

- **Loop prevention.** A workflow whose process step modifies a JCR path watched by a launcher will re-trigger itself. The `session` parameter on `WorkflowProcess.execute()` is a `WorkflowSession`, **not** a JCR `Session` — adapt it first (`javax.jcr.Session jcrSession = session.adaptTo(javax.jcr.Session.class);`) and tag the JCR `Session` with `jcrSession.getWorkspace().getObservationManager().setUserData("workflowmanager")` before the write so `WorkflowLauncherListener` ignores the resulting events. See `workflow-launchers` for the alternative `excludeList` / JCR-flag patterns.
- **JMX safety.** Never recommend executing JMX remediation operations (`restartStaleWorkflows`, `purgeCompleted(dryRun=false)`, `terminate`, etc.) without first confirming the target instance with the user. These affect live workflow state and are not reversible. Always pair with `dryRun=true` first when the operation supports it.
- **AEMaaCS stop-rule.** If the user's target is AEMaaCS, stop and load the cloud-service orchestrator — see Variant Scope above.

## How to Use This Skill

1. Read the user's request carefully.
2. Confirm the variant (6.5 LTS vs AEMaaCS) before routing — see Variant Scope.
3. Classify the request using the **Task Classifier** table below.
4. Load the identified sub-skill's `SKILL.md` and its references.
5. For development tasks, always load the `workflow-foundation` references alongside the sub-skill references.
6. The cross-cutting invariants above apply regardless of which sub-skill is loaded.

## Task Classifier

### Development Skills

| User Says / Asks | Sub-Skill to Load |
|---|---|
| "Create a workflow model", "Add steps to a workflow", "Design an OR split", "I need a parallel review" | `workflow-model-design` |
| "Implement a custom process step", "Write a WorkflowProcess", "Create a ParticipantStepChooser", "Dynamic participant" | `workflow-development` |
| "Start a workflow from code", "Trigger a workflow via API", "Use Manage Publication with a workflow", "HTTP REST API to start a workflow" | `workflow-triggering` |
| "Configure a launcher", "Auto-start on asset upload", "Launcher not firing", "cq:WorkflowLauncher", "Overlay an OOTB launcher" | `workflow-launchers` |
| "How do workflows work?", "What is the Granite Workflow Engine?", "Explain workflow architecture" | Load `workflow-foundation` references only |

### Debugging Skills

| User Says / Asks | Sub-Skill to Load |
|---|---|
| "Workflow is stuck", "Why isn't my workflow advancing?", "No work item", "Workflow failed", "Step shows error" | `workflow-debugging` |
| "Task not in Inbox", "User can't see work item", "Permissions error on workflow" | `workflow-debugging` |
| "Thread pool exhausted", "Auto-advancement not working", "Queue backlog", "Sling Jobs stuck" | `workflow-debugging` |
| "Repository bloat", "Too many workflow instances", "Purge not working", "Stale workflows" | `workflow-debugging` |
| "countStaleWorkflows", "restartStaleWorkflows", "retryFailedWorkItems", "JMX workflow", "returnSystemJobInfo", "queue depth via JMX" | `workflow-debugging` |

**Routing heuristic:**
- Building/implementing workflows → development skills (`workflow-model-design`, `workflow-development`, `workflow-triggering`, `workflow-launchers`)
- Diagnosis of a stuck or failed workflow on the user's accessible instance → `workflow-debugging` (decision trees, config checks, thread analysis, JMX remediation under the JMX-safety invariant above)
- Multi-instance / log-mining contexts (Splunk queries, host fleets, ticket classification, "errors across hosts for the past N hours") → `workflow-triaging` — **load only when the user explicitly invokes that context**, not by default

## AEM 6.5 LTS Guardrails Summary

Before doing anything, apply these constraints:

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Avoid editing `/libs` | Use overlays under `/apps` or store at `/conf/global` |
| Model design-time path | `/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/<id>` (preferred) or `/etc/workflow/models/<id>` (legacy) |
| Model runtime path (for API calls) | `/var/workflow/models/<id>` |
| Launcher config paths | `/conf/global/settings/workflow/launcher/config/` (preferred), `/apps/settings/workflow/launcher/config/` (overlay), or `/etc/workflow/launcher/config/` (legacy) |
| Service users | Use `ResourceResolverFactory.getServiceResourceResolver()` with a sub-service; avoid `loginAdministrative` |
| OSGi annotations | DS R6 preferred; Felix SCR still supported on 6.5 LTS |
| Deploy via | Package Manager (CRX Package), Maven + Content Package Plugin, or ACS AEM Commons JCR |
| No `javax.jcr.Session.loginAdministrative` | Deprecated — use `loginService()` or `ResourceResolverFactory` |
| Launcher run-mode restriction | The `runModes` property on `cq:WorkflowLauncher` is unreliable on 6.5 LTS — package the launcher's `.content.xml` under `config.author/` (or `config.publish/`) and let Sling's run-mode-aware OSGi config handling drive it |

## Common Task Patterns (End-to-End)

### Pattern A: New custom approval workflow

1. Load `workflow-model-design` + `workflow-development` sub-skills
2. Design model: START → PARTICIPANT (reviewer) → PROCESS (approve/reject logic) → END
3. Implement `WorkflowProcess` for the approve/reject step
4. Deploy model XML to `/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/` via Maven content package
5. Deploy OSGi bundle with the process step
6. Run **Tools → Workflow → Models → Sync** to push the design-time model to `/var/workflow/models/<id>` (the runtime path the engine reads). For Maven-driven iteration, use `mvn install -PautoInstallPackage` with `filter.xml` covering both `/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/<id>` and `/var/workflow/models/<id>` so design-time and runtime stay in sync.

### Pattern B: Auto-process content on upload

1. Load `workflow-launchers` sub-skill
2. Configure a `cq:WorkflowLauncher` for `NODE_ADDED` on the DAM path
3. Point it to your workflow model at `/var/workflow/models/`
4. Deploy launcher config to `/conf/global/settings/workflow/launcher/config/`

### Pattern C: Programmatically batch-start workflows

1. Load `workflow-triggering` sub-skill
2. Implement `WorkflowStarterService` using `ResourceResolverFactory` + `WorkflowSession`
3. Map sub-service `workflow-starter` to a **dedicated** service user with narrow ACLs (`jcr:read` on payload paths, `jcr:read` on `/var/workflow/models`, `jcr:write` on `/var/workflow/instances`). Do not reuse the OOTB `workflow-process-service` user — it carries broader privileges than a workflow starter needs.
4. Deploy and trigger from a Sling Scheduler or Servlet

### Pattern D: Replace OOTB DAM Update Asset launcher

1. Load `workflow-launchers` sub-skill
2. Overlay `dam_update_asset_create` from `/libs/settings/workflow/launcher/config/` to `/apps/settings/workflow/launcher/config/`
3. Set `enabled="{Boolean}false"` on the overlay
4. Create a new custom launcher pointing to your replacement model

### Pattern E: "Workflow stuck — not advancing"

1. Load `workflow-debugging` → classify as `workflow_stuck_not_progressing`
2. JMX `countStaleWorkflows` to check for stale instances
3. Follow decision tree: check for work item → step type → specific checks
4. If thread pool suspected, analyze config status ZIP (`039_Sling_Thread_Pools.txt`)
5. Return: root cause, JMX remediation (under the JMX-safety invariant — confirm target instance with the user before executing), config fix
