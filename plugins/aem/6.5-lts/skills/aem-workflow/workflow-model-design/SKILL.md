description: Design and create AEM Workflow models on AEM 6.5 LTS. Use when creating workflow models via the Workflow Model Editor or content package XML, defining step types (PROCESS, PARTICIPANT, DYNAMIC_PARTICIPANT, OR_SPLIT, AND_SPLIT), configuring step properties, declaring workflow variables, deploying to /etc or /conf, and syncing to /var/workflow/models via Package Manager or Maven.

# Workflow Model Design (AEM 6.5 LTS)

Design workflow models for AEM 6.5 LTS: step structure, transitions, OR/AND splits, variables, and model XML deployment via Package Manager.

## Audience

Developers and workflow designers building or modifying AEM 6.5 LTS workflow models — via the Workflow Model Editor or by hand-authoring model XML and shipping it as a content package.

## Variant Scope

- This skill is AEM 6.5 LTS only.
- Models can be stored at `/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/` (preferred) or `/etc/workflow/models/` (legacy — auto-deployed without Sync).
- **Not for AEM as a Cloud Service.** If the target instance is AEMaaCS, stop and use the cloud-service variant of this skill — `/etc/workflow/models/` is deprecated, the Sync flow differs, and several patterns documented here will produce models that fail to deploy.

## Dependencies

Models reference deployed `WorkflowProcess` and `ParticipantStepChooser` services by `process.label` / `chooser.label` or fully-qualified class name. **Build and deploy the Java step first; reference it from the model second.** A model that references a label whose service is not yet registered fails at runtime with `Process not found` — Sync will succeed and the model will appear in the editor, but instances will fail on first execution. See [workflow-development](../workflow-development/SKILL.md) for step implementation.

## Prerequisites

- AEM 6.5 LTS author instance reachable (local, dev, or sandbox).
- Maven project with `ui.content` module — or the ability to author in the Workflow Model Editor and export as a content package.
- Required `WorkflowProcess` / `ParticipantStepChooser` services already implemented and deployed (see Dependencies above).
- `filter.xml` covering the model path you intend to install, with `mode="merge"`.

## Required Permissions

- `workflow-editors` (or equivalent write access to `/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/`) — create or modify models in the Workflow Model Editor or via content package.
- `workflow-administrators` (or equivalent) — start test workflow instances and terminate stuck test instances during iteration.
- Read access to `/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/` and `/var/workflow/models/` for verification.

## Workflow

```text
Model Design Progress
- [ ] 1) Clarify the workflow purpose: what triggers it, what steps are needed, who approves
- [ ] 2) Map out steps: PROCESS (auto), PARTICIPANT (human), OR_SPLIT (decision), AND_SPLIT (parallel)
- [ ] 3) Decide payload type: single JCR_PATH or multi-page workflow package (a `cq:Page` collection, detected at runtime via `adaptTo(ResourceCollection.class)`)
- [ ] 4) Identify workflow variables needed for inter-step data passing
- [ ] 5) Design model XML: nodes + transitions + metaData with correct step properties
- [ ] 6) Choose storage: /conf (requires Sync) vs /etc (auto-deployed)
- [ ] 7) Add filter.xml entry with mode="merge"
- [ ] 8) Deploy via mvn install or Package Manager; verify sync to /var/workflow/models/, then open the model in the Workflow Model Editor and confirm all nodes render and transitions resolve
```

## Node Types Quick Reference

| Type | Purpose | Key metaData property |
|---|---|---|
| `START` | Entry point | — |
| `END` | Terminal | — |
| `PROCESS` | Auto-executed Java step | `PROCESS` = FQCN or process.label |
| `PARTICIPANT` | Human task (static assignee) | `PARTICIPANT` = principal name |
| `DYNAMIC_PARTICIPANT` | Human task (runtime assignee) | `DYNAMIC_PARTICIPANT` = chooser.label |
| `OR_SPLIT` | One branch selected by rule | Transition `rule` = ECMAScript (Rhino) |
| `AND_SPLIT` | All branches execute in parallel | — |
| `AND_JOIN` | Wait for all parallel branches | — |

## 6.5 LTS: /conf vs /etc

| Location | Sync Required | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| `/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/` | Yes — via UI or `deployModel()` | New models, forward-compatible |
| `/etc/workflow/models/` | No — auto-deployed | Legacy models, simple setups |

## Deployment

```bash
# Deploy via Maven
mvn clean install -P autoInstallPackage

# Or install package manually via Package Manager
http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr
```

## Architecture Considerations

These choices are made at design time and are hard to retrofit. Apply them before locking the model shape:

- **Transient vs persistent.** Set `transient="true"` on the model for high-volume, short-lived workflows (e.g., asset metadata extraction, replication side-effects). Transient instances create no JCR node under `/var/workflow/instances` until a retry or external-process step forces persistence — the difference between a healthy repository and unbounded growth.
- **Participant timeouts.** A `PARTICIPANT` step with no timeout can stall a workflow indefinitely and consume a job slot for the duration. For any human task that may not be acted on promptly, configure `TIMEOUT` and a `TIMEOUT_HANDLER` route on the step's metaData.
- **Goto retry caps.** Always enforce a hard cap on retry counters used by `Goto Step` rules (e.g., `count < 3`). An uncapped Goto loop will pin a worker thread and accumulate failed instances until the workflow is terminated by hand.
- **Purge is a design-time concern.** Estimate instance volume before go-live. Configure the **Adobe Granite Workflow Purge Configuration** factory in the same content package as the model so purge ships with the workflow, not as an after-the-fact follow-up. Set `scheduledpurge.purgePackagePayload=true` if the workflow uses workflow packages.
- **Model versioning.** In-flight instances stay bound to the model version they started with; new instances pick up the new version. When changing a deployed model, plan a brief drain window for old-version instances before declaring the change complete.
